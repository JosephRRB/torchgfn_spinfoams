### Using GFlowNets to compute the dihedral angle of the 4-simplex spin foam.

In this repository we present the results from computing an observable in the context of spin foams, a path integral framework for Quantum Gravity.

On how to produce the plots of the paper, refer to [this file](notebooks/README.md).
